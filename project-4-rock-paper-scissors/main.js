        //click event
//1. Each button element in index.html is given a 'click' addEventListener() via forEach() method
//2. the variable handName stores the data-selection value of the three button elements
//3. the name property of each object in the SELECTIONS global array is made equal to data-selection value in index.html - javascript is now connected to html buttons - this is stored in the playerSelection variable
//4. finally, chooseHand function is executed - with playerSelection as argument

        //chooseHand function
//5. halsSelection in chooseHand stores a random number between 0 - 2 via the randomSelect function - each number is an index of the SELECTIONS array - this will be the computer's selection upon each click event
//6. playerWinner and halWinner store the isWinner function - each with opposite arguments - isWinner returns a boolean based on whether the player/computer's object defeats property matches the opponent's name property
//7. two if statements check if playerWinner and halWinner are true - if true, increment function is executed with the respective score taken as an argument.
//8. finally, the addResult function is called twice to add the respective emojis to the tally - a new div element is created for both tallies, the element will cotain the chosen object's icon/emoji - the emojis are given the .result CSS style - an if statement checks if the passed winner argument is true, taken from the isWinner boolean - if true, the .winner CSS style is added to make the emoji full size/opacity
